<!-- NOTEASER -->

<p>PKGBUILDer is a very advanced, i.e. an application which builds AUR
packages. It can be used in conjunction with pacman (using <tt>pb</tt>). It
uses various techniques to automatize the process as much as possible.</p>

<p>It also includes a <tt>pb</tt> script (aka PBWrapper), which makes pacman
and PKGBUILder work together.</p>
