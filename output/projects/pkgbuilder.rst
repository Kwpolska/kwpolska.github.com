PKGBUILDer is a very advanced, i.e. an application which builds AUR
packages. It can be used in conjunction with pacman (using ``pb``). It
uses various techniques to automatize the process as much as possible.

It also includes a ``pb`` script (aka PBWrapper), which makes pacman
and PKGBUILder work together.
